== Versions

This is the compatibility version table of the current Chinook release:

.Compatibility table
|===

|name|version

|chinook
|{chinook-core}

|spark-java
|{spark-java}

|frege-core
|{frege-core}

|frege-repl
|{frege-repl}

|jdk
|{target-jdk}+
|===

IMPORTANT: Because Frege is evolving at fast pace, at least at the
moment, Chinook is trying to follow latest versions of Frege. That's
why I thought it would be important to have a chapter where users
would see a compatibility table of the current release.
